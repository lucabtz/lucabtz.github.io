Hello my name is Luca Bertozzi, I have a master degree in Theoretical Physics, but I have always been passionate about
computers and have been coding since a long time now: thus I am now switching and going into cybersecurity.

This blog will mainly be on cybersecurity topics however I may occasionally talk about Computer Science,
Physics or Science in general. I hope you will find interesting reads in here.
